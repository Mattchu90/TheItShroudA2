    <p>I was born in Australian, my father is Australian and my mother is Dutch and have mainly worked in the construction industry after studying the built environment through Tafe. I was an active life-saver in my younger days and an Australian National Kayak champion at age 14. I’m happily married with two children and enjoy spending all my spare time with my family. I’ve had an interest in computing from a young age and played around with some basic programming on the old Commodore 64 but really played more games than anything else. Over the last 7yrs I’ve had the opportunity to work closely with the external IT service providers through the mid-tier construction company that I work for. I’ve thoroughly enjoyed putting together the IT infrastructure and software solutions to support the company to construct multi-storey commercial building all over South East Queensland. </p>
