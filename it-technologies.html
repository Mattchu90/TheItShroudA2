<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2> 
<h3>What does it do?</h3>   
<p>Autonomous Vehicles are any vehicle that is able to sense its environment and move around it, without any human input. This technology is still in its early development stage with few commercially available self-driving cars, or farm equipment ready for the general public. There are different levels of autonomy that have been developed so far and are also being researched, as described below.</p>

<p>Some vehicle makes such as Volkswagen and Chrysler offer Level 2 autonomy today. This level on the road offers increased safety to the occupants of the vehicle and those around it. Emergency braking controlled by a computer means instant reaction to a potential collision, removing the natural delay in human reaction. Lane assist keeps the vehicle in its designated lane (or what the vehicle interprets as its lane) for a short period of time before alerting the driver that it needs human input, or it will immediately pullover itself and come to a stop. This function may save a tired driver from falling asleep at the wheel and causing an accident, through the alert or the emergency braking. It also helps keep the vehicle in its lane if the driver becomes distracted by audio/visual entertainment, a passenger or passing scenery. These Level 2 vehicles use radar, cameras and sensors to determine the position of itself in the environment and to detect an object or another vehicle. 
Level 3 vehicles and upwards need to use more, new technology. LIDAR is Laser Illuminating Detection and Ranging technology. This is a combination between radar and laser beams. This system works by using radar and spinning the lasers around the vehicle quickly, to scan the environment and gather data. It then develops a three-dimensional map that allows the vehicle to determine its position within the environment. Digital maps and GPS also help the vehicle know where it is and where to go. This information would have no use without advanced algorithms that process the gathered data and let the vehicle react to real-time hazards such as traffic, road works, pedestrians, animals and weather conditions. (Time USA, 2019)</p>

<p>Autonomy is not just limited to cars, it is also being developed for farm vehicles. Companies such as John Deere have been developing autonomous solutions for the farmer. Their system called “iTEC Pro” uses GPS tracking and coordinates to allow the vehicle to operate itself, but still require some human input (Nanalyze, 2019).   
Within the next three years, it is unlikely that technology would have progressed past Level 2 autonomy, but research will be well underway.</p>  
    
<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>Self-driving technology is an exciting area of IT and will have a huge impact on the world. In the future if Level 5 autonomy becomes a reality, it may remove the necessity for people to own cars. Cars could be ordered to pick up or drop off people when required. If every car was a fully electric vehicle, and the power stations used to charge those vehicles were completely powered by renewable energy, we would have a totally carbon emission free transportation system. This raises another question on whether all vehicles were controlled by a singular computer on each vehicle, or controlled by one central computer in each district. A “hive mind” mentality may be the answer to smoothen the flow of traffic, and congestion may be a thing of the past as the systems would work together seamlessly, even in peak hours. Road rage would be a thing of the past because the occupants of the vehicle would not be focused on competing with other drives over petty occurrences like letting someone merge into a lane. This makes the road are safer place- providing the central computer controlling the traffic was not hackable and prone to malicious intent.  
All of these advancements however, would make many jobs obsolete. Taxi drivers, couriers and truck drivers; especially those that deliver large loads to companies (rather than the mail man), would become redundant. The only human input may be on either side of the trip when the vehicle needs to be unloaded and loaded with goods. But even then, depots may also be automated at this point in technological advancement, furthering the possibility of making more jobs redundant. This could very well become a possibility as businesses would save a lot of money on wages and would allow transportation logistics to run around the clock, and that is very attractive in increasing profits.  </p>
    
<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>If humanity progresses to autonomous vehicles, it will be a hard bridge to cross for many. There are many people on Earth who love cars. They love the sound they make, the way they look and enjoy working on and restoring them. Will autonomy change that culture? In the long term that may indeed be the case. But over the last century and half, human civilisation has progressed from horse and cart, all the way to hybrid vehicles. There would have been people of yesteryear who enjoyed stage coaches- looking at, riding in and restoring them. But time breeds a new kind of person with each generation, and those people that enjoyed the old v8’s will be gone and replaced with people who love their autonomous vehicle. For me, my family and many of my friends, changing over to self-driven cars will be a difficult step forward to accept. It is very likely that the process could take 50 years and that future generations will be the ones to have Level 5 autonomy, and by then they may be used to it to some extent. But for the time being, lane assist, adaptive cruise control and emergency braking are all welcome technologies as they make the roads a safer place. Farm vehicles that are self-driven let farmers potentially spend more time with their families than out on a paddock- or run multiple vehicles to increase their efficiency. If the future transportation system is autonomous and based on a renewable energy infrastructure, then it will be a bright step forward in reducing the human populations’ carbon footprint.</p>
