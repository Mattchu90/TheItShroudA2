<h1>IT Technologies</h1>
    
<h2>Natural Language Processing Chatterbots</h2>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>
<p>Natural language processing through AI & deep-learning, is the platform from which systems can understand your messages and respond appropriately, one use of this being ‘Chatbots’. More specifically Natural Language Processing (NLP) is a way of analysing texts by computerised means, to gather knowledge, in order to develop appropriate tools and techniques which could make computer systems understand and manipulate natural languages.</p> 
<p>At this stage, one of the most commonly known, and state of the art utilisations of NLP can be found in Google’s AI branch. Particularly their development of the B.E.R.T model ( Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers). This model has allowed Google to produce products such as the Google Assistant which are capable of question answering, named entity recognition and other tasks related to general language understanding. In addition to the use of NLP for virtual assistants- NLP has been used to create targeted advertising models through online search queries or online behaviours. A state-of-the-art version of this can be seen in Facebooks open source ‘PyText’ which is the premise for a lot of their targeted advertising on the platform.</p> 
<p>Similarly NLP has led to strides such as that of Mitsuku, a bot that some consider as having beaten the Turing Test, a test of a computer's ability to communicate indistinguishably from a human. Although Mitsuku can hold passable levels of conversation- the bot will often give answers that are entertainingly weird, and there is still a way to go before dialogue with a bot becomes absolutely indistinguishable from that of another person.</p> 
<p>However, in the near future, in all likelihood, NLP (subsequently chatbots) will advance to a point where it will be able to convey and understand language at a near human level. For example the rollout of Google’s Duplex Assistant (Chatbot) in (year) will mark a new age of interpersonal services accomplished through AI. The software can autonomously carry tasks with businesses over the phone with the same apparent qualities as a real person would. The distinctive nature of its speech is how believable it is: Duplex uses human-like pauses, colloquial expressions, diYerent tones and even speech disfuencies such as “ahs”, “umms” and “mm-hmm”, as noted by Washington Post. Additionally, from a computational understanding of natural language- we will see a rise in the complexity of information generated from unstructured qualitative information. One outcome of this is the ability to construct deeply insightful customer/psychological profiles based on the masses of information from someone’s digital footprint ( something that is already somewhat done through targeted advertising). Furthermore, based on those customer/psychological profiles- it is reasonable to assume that we will see pre-emptive services from Virtual Assistants. Services such as Amazon ‘Alexa, for example, can already accomplish many tasks. Alexa is capable of shopping (aware of everything you previously purchased through Amazon); structure your mornings, including accounting for upcoming meetings, traffic, and weather; entertain one with music; suggest movies, shows, or audiobooks; and control one’s smart appliances at home.</p> 
<p>The developments that would promote these software advanced would be in the fields of deep learning and AI, particularly neural networking. Moreover- strides in computational processing power, a field that experiences exponential growth year to year, would have significant effects on the speeds at which more complex Natural Language Processing could take place.</p> 
    
<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>    
<p>The impact of such developments poses difficult ethical, economic and social challenges- all the while still making our lives easier on a day to day basis. From a socialisation standpoint- the more advanced NPL based chatbots and similar models become, the less day to day human interaction will be experienced. Moreover, from an ethical perspective- the more we interact with Chatbots, the less privacy we have. Take for instance a recent warrant that was served to Amazon, with the hopes of seizing the audio recordings and transcripts that were created as a result of interactions with defendant’s Amazon Echo. The Echo’s understanding of us which make them feel so natural are curated around data from our interactions with them, and as such those with access to the data can reconstruct “the sum of an individual’s private life.” Hence, it goes without saying that we should tread lightly around the adoption and advancement of Natural Language Processing.</p>
<p>The most visible changes will be seen in the workforce- with many, of what were once stable jobs, becoming redundant. For example, AI based telemarketing startup ‘Rosponseai’ utilises a similar NPL model to Google’s Duplex and looks primed to disrupt telemarketing. An industry which in the UK for example accounts for over 3.5% of workforce.</p>
    
<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>From a personal perspective, I am already in the midst of utilising services such as Google Assistant, FAQ Chatbots to resolve consumer queries, and sometimes engage targeted advertisements to make purchase decisions. As the chatbots and other NPL based services become more advanced- I can only assume that my life will become more streamlined, involve less mediocre tasks, and my overall quality of life will improve. On the other hand- I foresee significant issues with my privacy, an invasive level of advertising and the removal of industries and jobs that will have perpetuating effects on my life. Furthermore, I foresee less human interaction- which may have long lasting effects on my ability to engage in social activities. The impact of advanced NPL and chatbots- is felt most from the economic perspective of my family. Many extended members of my family operate in high-volume sales roles- a position which in all likelihood will be irrelevant due to highly effective targeted advertising curated through Natural Language Processing. Furthermore, my aunt has worked as an assistant her whole life, yet many of the fundamental tasks of the role are looking to be replaced with virtual assistants within the next few years. </p>
<p>Overall, the progression of Chatbots and other NPL based services are an in inevitable facet of society. Automation and economic efficiency always take precedence ever since the dawn of the industrial revolution- it is however of the upmost importance that we remain vigilant and consider the consequences of adopting such technologies, as the social, ethical and economic effects are far reaching. </p>

<h2>Raspberry Pi</h2>
<h3>What does it do?</h3>   
<p>A Raspberry Pi is a tiny computer and was initially created to help educate young people the basics of computer science but has been used for more than what it was intended for. The Raspberry Pi has a range of projects and an (almost) endless amount of possibilities with its ability to interact with the outside world. This ultra-tiny-capable device that allows people to not only start exploring computing but allows them to learn how to program in languages such as python and scratch. The Raspberry Pi recently came out with with a new product, the Raspberry Pi 4. The new product pro's inlcude faster speeds, USB 3 ports, 4K capabilities with video at 60Hz and dual monitor support. Con's includes the main software doesn't work at launch and a poor video playback. As the RP4 hasn't been release for too long, its limitations have not been discovered, but the RP3 does have limitations especially when coming from the RP2. The powerful RP3 has the capability to create a great number of powerful machines, such as a PC, retro game machine and an entire media centre. From these examples, we can gather that the Raspberry Pi is quite a robust machine and has great capabilities that are being tested everyday. With the arrival of the RP4, greater capabilites will be unlocked and with the capabiliteis mentioned earlier, will be able to create much more powerful machines with a focus on display, as the new device is 4K orientated with an  output of 60Hz and this is because of the newly implemented HDMI port instead of the old micro HDMI which couldn't hand the capabilites. The performance increase making the whole device a lot quicker compared to its predecessors allowing even greater ideas to be created. One thing that became popular amongst many articles are the possibilities of the Raspberry Pi 4 for intereference in terms of objecy and sound detection. However there are a couple of cons with this new device with the main one being its backward compatibility. As of writing this, the operating system used by the Pi, Raspbian Buster, is outdated and you are not able to use the same one you would have used for the older versions of the Pi. There are issues that branch from this too, with no everything running on the Buster as of yet which includes a couple of libraries and other packages that weren't compatible with that OS.</p>
    
<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>With the implementation of Raspberry Pi's, new devices are being created that increase the efficient and ease in which we live our lives. Examples can be shown in Matthew and I's project where they have used Raspberry Pi's to activate a smarter and more automated side of living. The potential impact of this technology and the Raspberry Pi's beig implemented more frequently has both pro's and cons. The positive from an education standpoint allow users of all ages and knowledge to gain a basic understanding of how computers work and how they talk to each other. Other pros include streamlining certain processes that we do everyday such as opening doors and turning on lights by using devices like the Raspberry Pi to connect everything and create whatever suits the user, which in our opinion, is quite amazing as these devices allow a certain part of personalisation as long as you have a brief understanding of how it works. However, there are cons that can affect this type of technology. Examples of this include the risk of having these types of technologies fail whihc can be detrimental to the user depending on what the user is using it for (opening and closing doors etc.). The likely impact of the implementation and further development of these devices will allow users to gain a greater understanding of simple computers as well as having greater ease creating and developing their own system as better operatin systems and apps become introduced into the system, much like RP4 and Retropie (which is a retro gaming emulator that could be loaded onto the Pi) which cannot be completed as of yet as more libraries and packages become available to its users. Companies that specialise in home automation might receive less business annd their main selling point, home automation, can be done with way less work and it can also be way cheaper. However, those said companies will have also developed a system that can be better than what you are able to create as well as the integration of other forms of IT that are used, for example having the same program and application for the alarm system and camera control centre. Trying to create something similar and for it to be as seamless may be more work than it is worth. This could also work in favour of those companies, as they're able to develop and implement better systems as the technology develops.</p>
    
<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>I believe that these devices if implemented can affect my life in a positive light. I am able to create devices that allow me to have more control over what goes on in my household and workspace by customising and streamlining certain processes to make life easier for me such as the home automation that Matthew has come up with. Being able to control lights from anywhere in the house and possible come up with timers that switch of lights at a certain time for example can create more efficiency in everyday life. I believe that because Raspberry Pi's are so customisable, there would be a certain degree of difference between what I would do to suit me and what others may do. The difference for me is that I would use these forms of technologies based around my home. Checking level sensors of watertanks, automating garage doors and using an application so I could remove the button off my keys, placing an air conditioning app so I can control the AC from my phone are just some examples of what I could do with this amazing device. As I still live at home as does the rest of my family, having changed the system that they all are so used to can create a challenge for myself as I would need to make sure that when developing said applications, that they work not only for me but for other members of my family. Another obstacle that would affect my family would be training them to use the application or program. Training my parents as they are not too teech savvy and live by the term "if it ain't broke, don't fix it" attitude whcih will make it harder for myself to fully convert them over to one system. However, after they learn the process, this would again make life easier and more efficient for them as they can control almost the entire house through apps either on phones or computers. </p>

<h2>Autonomous Vehicles</h2> 
<h3>What does it do?</h3>   
<p>Autonomous Vehicles are any vehicle that is able to sense its environment and move around it, without any human input. This technology is still in its early development stage with few commercially available self-driving cars, or farm equipment ready for the general public. There are different levels of autonomy that have been developed so far and are also being researched, as described below.</p> 

	
<table style="width:100%">

(Union of Concerned Scientists, 2018)
	

<p>Some vehicle makes such as Volkswagen and Chrysler offer Level 2 autonomy today. This level on the road offers increased safety to the occupants of the vehicle and those around it. Emergency braking controlled by a computer means instant reaction to a potential collision, removing the natural delay in human reaction. Lane assist keeps the vehicle in its designated lane (or what the vehicle interprets as its lane) for a short period of time before alerting the driver that it needs human input, or it will immediately pullover itself and come to a stop. This function may save a tired driver from falling asleep at the wheel and causing an accident, through the alert or the emergency braking. It also helps keep the vehicle in its lane if the driver becomes distracted by audio/visual entertainment, a passenger or passing scenery. These Level 2 vehicles use radar, cameras and sensors to determine the position of itself in the environment and to detect an object or another vehicle. 
Level 3 vehicles and upwards need to use more, new technology. LIDAR is Laser Illuminating Detection and Ranging technology. This is a combination between radar and laser beams. This system works by using radar and spinning the lasers around the vehicle quickly, to scan the environment and gather data. It then develops a three-dimensional map that allows the vehicle to determine its position within the environment. Digital maps and GPS also help the vehicle know where it is and where to go. This information would have no use without advanced algorithms that process the gathered data and let the vehicle react to real-time hazards such as traffic, road works, pedestrians, animals and weather conditions. (Time USA, 2019)</p>

<p>Autonomy is not just limited to cars, it is also being developed for farm vehicles. Companies such as John Deere have been developing autonomous solutions for the farmer. Their system called “iTEC Pro” uses GPS tracking and coordinates to allow the vehicle to operate itself, but still require some human input (Nanalyze, 2019).   
Within the next three years, it is unlikely that technology would have progressed past Level 2 autonomy, but research will be well underway.</p>  
    
<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>Self-driving technology is an exciting area of IT and will have a huge impact on the world. In the future if Level 5 autonomy becomes a reality, it may remove the necessity for people to own cars. Cars could be ordered to pick up or drop off people when required. If every car was a fully electric vehicle, and the power stations used to charge those vehicles were completely powered by renewable energy, we would have a totally carbon emission free transportation system. This raises another question on whether all vehicles were controlled by a singular computer on each vehicle, or controlled by one central computer in each district. A “hive mind” mentality may be the answer to smoothen the flow of traffic, and congestion may be a thing of the past as the systems would work together seamlessly, even in peak hours. Road rage would be a thing of the past because the occupants of the vehicle would not be focused on competing with other drives over petty occurrences like letting someone merge into a lane. This makes the road are safer place- providing the central computer controlling the traffic was not hackable and prone to malicious intent.  
All of these advancements however, would make many jobs obsolete. Taxi drivers, couriers and truck drivers; especially those that deliver large loads to companies (rather than the mail man), would become redundant. The only human input may be on either side of the trip when the vehicle needs to be unloaded and loaded with goods. But even then, depots may also be automated at this point in technological advancement, furthering the possibility of making more jobs redundant. This could very well become a possibility as businesses would save a lot of money on wages and would allow transportation logistics to run around the clock, and that is very attractive in increasing profits.  </p>
    
<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>If humanity progresses to autonomous vehicles, it will be a hard bridge to cross for many. There are many people on Earth who love cars. They love the sound they make, the way they look and enjoy working on and restoring them. Will autonomy change that culture? In the long term that may indeed be the case. But over the last century and half, human civilisation has progressed from horse and cart, all the way to hybrid vehicles. There would have been people of yesteryear who enjoyed stage coaches- looking at, riding in and restoring them. But time breeds a new kind of person with each generation, and those people that enjoyed the old v8’s will be gone and replaced with people who love their autonomous vehicle. For me, my family and many of my friends, changing over to self-driven cars will be a difficult step forward to accept. It is very likely that the process could take 50 years and that future generations will be the ones to have Level 5 autonomy, and by then they may be used to it to some extent. But for the time being, lane assist, adaptive cruise control and emergency braking are all welcome technologies as they make the roads a safer place. Farm vehicles that are self-driven let farmers potentially spend more time with their families than out on a paddock- or run multiple vehicles to increase their efficiency. If the future transportation system is autonomous and based on a renewable energy infrastructure, then it will be a bright step forward in reducing the human populations’ carbon footprint.</p>    
    
<p style="text-align: center;">&nbsp;</p>    
    
<h2>Clouds, Services, Servers</h2> 
<h3>What does it do?</h3>   
<p>The way we are all accessing and storing data has been constantly evolving. From on-premise servers through to Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and including hybrid models which can be hosted in external providers data centres. They all provide similar functionality and storage facilities but just in different locations and configurations.</p>
<p>On-premise servers have long been seen as a traditional method to run a business’s applications and store their associated files. This provides direct access for a business to their data through their own network and control over their environment. The draw back on this model is the cost to replace and maintain the infrastructure which can put pressure on the cashflow of a business due to the bulk purchasing outlay of the equipment. This also becomes a financial burden when the infrastructure approaches end of life and requires upgrading to more modern computing power. But the days of on-premise servers to handle the day to day operations of a business is now trending to move towards cloud-based server farms and services. </p>
<Cloud base services provide businesses with flexibility and scalability by using an external party to host varying types of infrastructure models. This means that a business can still utilise the same applications and operating systems but run and store their data from within a service providers hosting environment without the need to purchase hardware which is known as Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). Another model is where the hosting environment also provides the infrastructure as well as the operating systems. All the business needs to do is only runs their own applications and manages their own data. This is known as Platform as a Service (PaaS).  Having all a businesses application’s fully hosted and managed through external providers environments, where the applications are purchased on a subscription basis, is known as Software as a Service (SaaS).</p>
<p>The SaaS model is sometimes referred to a serverless computing and is the software architecture that has been growing more and more popular with businesses where it eliminates the need to fully maintain computing infrastructure. This doesn’t mean that servers don’t exist, it does mean that business will not have a requirement for major computing infrastructure and makes the service provider fully responsible for maintaining and provisioning an accessible run-time environment.</p>
<p>As the responsibility moves over to the service provider they need to ensure that access to their environments are continuous available to maintain connectivity in line with their SLA’s provided to their clients. This can be achieved with such software as Kubernetes which is an engine that provides a production-ready environment for deploying applications (Kubernetes.io, 2019). This allows for multiple instances of applications to be running simultaneously in a host’s environment. Maintenance and upgrades can then be performed and rolled out progressively without the need to take the application fully off line ensuring continuity of service.</p>
<p>With more and more mobile devices also connecting and transmitting data as part of the increasing Internet of Things (IoT) concept wide area network latency needs to be considered which is caused by the location of cloud-based data centres. This has brought about the introduction of edge computing concepts to bring resources closer to end users. This concept is not designed to replace the cloud computing model but to help facilitate the connectivity of delay sensitive applications.</p>
<p>The minimisation of the effects of latency can also be aided with the introduction of the new 5G network, which focused on mobile data, the transfer rate of data is set to increase substantially from the 4G network to provide faster connectivity. Download speeds are expected to be a minimum of about 100Mbps (Choros, 2019) but is currently only available to a small area of the community. The number of devices that have the ability to utilise the new 5G network infrastructure is still very limited but is set to expand substantially in the coming years.</p>
    
<h3>What is the likely impact?</h3>
<p>The likely impact with the coming change to a more SaaS model is the requirement for connectivity to more powerful cloud-based infrastructure. But as software requirements move to these environments the need to have powerful personal computing may become less. With the cost of storage becoming cheaper and cheaper people are tending more to manage their personal data in cloud environments (i.e. Microsoft’s On-drive, Apple’s iCloud, etc.). Business can utilise thin client computing to allow for remote connection to cloud-based environments where these devices only contain limited resources and makes the cloud-based servers do most of the work.</p>
<p>In cloud-based SaaS environments the requirement to manage redundancy and disaster recovery measures move over to the services providers, taking this responsibility away from businesses owners to manage. One main concern is the network security of service providers environments as people are relying on these providers to keep their clients data safe. Current security methods and up to date protocols are required to ensure that peoples and businesses data remain in a secure environment. This can open the door to more job opportunities for cybersecurity professionals.</p>
<p>As previously discussed, the requirement to reduce network latency for delay sensitive applications and the handling of IoT device data transmissions will become more prevalent. This could result in the fast track expansion of the 5G network and edge computing network environment generation.</p>
    
<h3>How will this affect you?</h3>
<p>I believe that there will be a gradual change in the way we interface with the application that we use in our everyday life. From the way that we store our files and how it can be accessed from multiple devices to how we communicate with those around us.</p>
<p>Changes to the way application providers have moved towards a subscription-based pricing structure have provided flexibility to only pay for what you use but have taken away the permanency that you used to get when purchasing a licence outright. If you don’t continually pay for an application service, you may find that you are unable to work with aspects of the files that you have created. In the business world I believe that this structure works well to maximise the efficiency on licence costs as you only pay for licences that you currently need allowing scalability with their workforce.</p>
<p>In relation to working environment interfaces the ability to work from any location as well as more collaboration opportunities, through more advanced platforms like Microsoft Teams, gives us more flexibility to manage our time bringing a better work/life balance.</p>
<p>We have been becoming more and more connected in all aspects of our lives for some time now but through the advances in the above technologies and platforms it has made the transfer of data and information easier as well as such things like video chatting with family and friends all over the globe but is still mainly dependent on access to a decent internet connection.</p>
