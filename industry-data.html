<h2>Job Titles</h2>
<p>Our groups dream jobs and their titles had quite a bit of range in terms of the skills required and the actual title of the job. However, in saying that, the most notable generic skills that were needed by our dream jobs all fit the description of these skills. Certain main skills such as communication skills and organisational skills were all a big part and majority of the time a must when in those roles</p>

<h3>Jackson Shepherd - Director of IT Operations</h3>
<p>My ideal job - Director of IT Operations - is defined as someone who looks after and maintains the IT environment in a workplace. The employee who holds this job should be able to not only maintain but introduce new technologies to further improve and develop the business to make operations more efficient. This type of job seems to be quite popular when referencing to the Burning glass data. A system administrator, which is a key IT skill that is requried by an IT operations manager, seems to scale quite high in employer searches with 681 postings in March of 2017 to March of 2018.</p>
    
<p>Keeping the Burning Glass data in mind, my idea job has not changed. I believe that with the popularity that the systems administrator comes with, it will be easier to find a job with the title similar to the IT Operations manager as well as having not only the skills (IT or non-IT) but also having the experience that I am gaining through my current job. </p>

<h3>IT Specific Skills</h3>
<h4>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
<p>We believe that all jobs that our group have decided on all need the top two general skills in term of demand from employers. These include communication skills and problem solving which have a combined total of ‭60,812‬ post searches of a range of a year. We as a group consider these as the most important skills because they are key skills which allow the employers to communicate ideas and issues to other employees who are not so tech savvy as well as people who work under or with this employee. Problem solving skills are also important as they allow the users to fix issues that could be detrimental to the business such as EFTPOS systems etc. </p>
