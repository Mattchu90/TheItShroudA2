<h2>Job Titles</h2>
<p>Our groups dream jobs and their titles had quite a bit of range in terms of the skills required and the actual title of the job. However, in saying that, the most notable generic skills that were needed by our dream jobs all fit the description of these skills. Certain main skills such as communication skills and organisational skills were all a big part and majority of the time a must when in those roles</p>
