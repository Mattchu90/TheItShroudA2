<h1>Industry Data</h1>

<h2>Job Titles</h2>
<p>Our groups dream jobs and their titles had quite a bit of range in terms of the skills required and the actual title of the job. However, in saying that, the most notable generic skills that were needed by our dream jobs all fit the description of these skills. Certain main skills such as communication skills and organisational skills were all a big part and majority of the time a must when in those roles</p>

<h3>Matthew Andrews - Communication Technician</h3>
<p>Looking at Burning Glass data, it doesn’t appear that there is a high demand for Communication Technician roles. As mentioned above, organisational and communication skills will both be important in this role and all others. As a Comm-Tech, you should be comfortable with team work, trouble shooting, Microsoft Windows and Office, building relationships, providing technical support and customer service. All of these rank highly in terms of demand from potential employers.  
The highly ranked SQL, JavaScript and JAVA are not in my IT Specific required skill set for this role. Writing, mentoring, and presentation skills are also not in my required skill set as a Communications Technician.</p>
<p>Over the years, I have accumulated a lot of experience with the generic skills needed to fulfill a role in Comm-Tech. I will need to study hard and gain relevant IT experience however, to be successful. With this in mind, I am still confident about this position and having looked at the Burning Glass data, I have not changed my mind.</p>

<h3>Jason Chilman - Chief Information Officer</h3>
<p>From reviewing the Burning Glass data there doesn’t appear to be any records relating to my ideal job. This has not changed my perspective or opinion on the type of position that I would ideally like to do as a job even though it doesn’t look to be in high demand. I choose my ideal job more because it involves putting together complete IT and IS solutions as well as including strategic planning, budget assessments and resourcing management. I believe that working in such a diverse area of the IT field as well as at a high level which allows for research and development for implementation of new platforms would keep me so enthralled that I wouldn’t see it as a job. </p>   
<p>A Chief Information Officer requires project management skills which incorporate problem solving and organizational skills as well as effective communication skills. These skills are highly sort after skills based on the Burning Glass ‘Skills in the Greatest Demand’. So should there not be a position available I would have developed skills that can be adopted to other fields if required.</p>

<h3>Quinn Goh - Technical Lead (Digital Media)</h3>
<p>My ideal job would pivot on the combination of my degree in IT and my current occupation in Television Production. In order to do that I believe a job such as a Technical Lead at a digital or media production agency would make the most use of my skills and future skills. In an upper management position- it would be a great opportunity to direct digital strategy. According to the job description- the role suggests over a decade of IT industry experience, and a formal qualification in some facet of IT. In terms of skills, it requires management capabilities coupled with a deep understanding of software engineering.</p>    
<p>Having looked at the Burning Glass Data, it has reaffirmed my desire to be a Digital Lead. The ‘transferrable skills’ that I would develop in the role are versatile and have the capacity to carry me through many roles to come. Moreover, Media Industry roles are ranked 2nd highest in terms of future prospectus. With these in mind I stand by my initial thoughts.</p>

<h3>Jackson Shepherd - Director of IT Operations</h3>
<p>My ideal job - Director of IT Operations - is defined as someone who looks after and maintains the IT environment in a workplace. The employee who holds this job should be able to not only maintain but introduce new technologies to further improve and develop the business to make operations more efficient. This type of job seems to be quite popular when referencing to the Burning glass data. A system administrator, which is a key IT skill that is requried by an IT operations manager, seems to scale quite high in employer searches with 681 postings in March of 2017 to March of 2018.</p>
    
<p>Keeping the Burning Glass data in mind, my idea job has not changed. I believe that with the popularity that the systems administrator comes with, it will be easier to find a job with the title similar to the IT Operations manager as well as having not only the skills (IT or non-IT) but also having the experience that I am gaining through my current job. </p>

<h3>IT Specific Skills</h3>
<h4>How do the general skills in your required skill set rank in terms of demand from employers?</h4>
<p>We believe that all jobs that our group have decided on all need the top two general skills in term of demand from employers. These include communication skills and problem solving which have a combined total of ‭60,812‬ post searches of a range of a year. We as a group consider these as the most important skills because they are key skills which allow the employers to communicate ideas and issues to other employees who are not so tech savvy as well as people who work under or with this employee. Problem solving skills are also important as they allow the users to fix issues that could be detrimental to the business such as EFTPOS systems etc. </p>
